# Housing Location Finder

On this project, you can search and review listings in the city of your choice.

## Getting Started

To run this locally on your machine, clone down a copy of the project.

CD into the project and use the command "npm install" to install the dependacies.

You'll need to open up two terminal windows

1. Use "ng serve --open" to open the project in localhost
2. In another terminal window, use the command "json-server --watch db.json" to start the mock db using the json file. (Add the extension "json-serve" if you dont have it already.)

## Review Website

You can now do a search of a city you would like to visit or browser the listings on the home page.
